## Current System Capabilities

### Repository Scanning
- **Supported Ecosystems**: npm (Node.js), pip (Python), composer (PHP), Gemfile (Ruby), Cargo.toml (Rust)
- **Automatic Detection**: Recursively scans directories while ignoring common build/cache folders
- **Dependency Extraction**: Parses manifest files to extract dependency names and versions
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates during scanning process

### Vulnerability Detection
- **OSV.dev Integration**: Queries comprehensive vulnerability database
- **Version Matching**: Checks specific dependency versions against known vulnerabilities
- **Severity Analysis**: Categorizes vulnerabilities by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Detailed Reports**: Provides vulnerability summaries, details, and reference links

### Data Management
- **User Isolation**: Each user's repositories and data are properly segregated
- **Efficient Storage**: Optimized database schemas with proper indexing
- **Data Integrity**: Validation at both application and database levels
- **Audit Trail**: Tracking of scan dates and repository status changes

### User Experience
- **Intuitive Dashboard**: Clean interface for repository management
- **Real-time Feedback**: Live updates during scanning operations
- **Visual Analytics**: Charts and treemaps for vulnerability data
- **Cross-platform**: Works as both web application and desktop app

## Technical Debt and Future Considerations

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Current State**: Limited automated testing
- **Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Priority**: High - Critical for maintaining code quality as system grows

### Performance Optimization
- **Current State**: Basic optimization implemented
- **Opportunities**: Caching strategies, database query optimization, frontend bundle optimization
- **Priority**: Medium - Monitor as user base and data volume grow

### Security Enhancements
- **Current State**: Basic security measures in place
- **Improvements**: Rate limiting, input sanitization, security headers
- **Priority**: High - Essential for production deployment

### Scalability Planning
- **Current State**: Single-instance deployment
- **Considerations**: Database scaling, API rate limiting, background job processing
- **Priority**: Low - Address when approaching capacity limits

## Development Patterns Established

### Code Organization
- **Backend**: Clear separation of concerns with controllers, models, routes, and utilities
- **Frontend**: Component-based architecture with proper state management
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration with secure secret management

### Error Handling
- **Consistent Patterns**: Standardized error responses and logging
- **User Feedback**: Meaningful error messages and loading states
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues functioning when non-critical components fail

### Real-time Features
- **Socket.io Integration**: Efficient real-time communication for scanning progress
- **Event-driven Architecture**: Proper event handling and cleanup
- **Connection Management**: Robust connection handling with reconnection logic
